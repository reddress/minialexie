Look for FIXMEs

Pass a successUrl to transactionUpdate inside Update form as a hidden item name="prevUrl", so that after editing, we redirect to prevUrl

Format date as d/m/y in transaction create/update form

Search: use GET, , search within session dates. Entire path becomes prevUrl in date preset links (calendar icon)
Search view: use accountRead with accountName = Search results

Hide error pages (set DEBUG=False?)

Pie charts in index, move accountType summaries to a new URL

Wishlist
========

New demo users must be created each time, otherwise, when a new demo user logs in, the previous person using demo will suddenly have all data reset 

Fill in more bogus transactions for demoUser (at the end of benny/models.py)

Checkboxes for transactions to delete several at once

Reorder AccountTypes in index in any order, drag and drop in right order (use jQuery UI Sortable)

When moving accounts to another type, its 'order' must be placed last

Resolved
========

Create a table in accountRead template, compute total

Filter to display {{ transaction.amount }} as whole amount, dot and cents - IN BENNY, AMOUNT IS A DECIMAL

Setting and remembering from/to dates: GET parameters in URL or store in session? - SESSION, LESS CLUTTER

Create account link from AccountType automatically selects the right choice from select box

Obsolete
========

Parse from and to dates from GET parameters ( /benny?from=2016-01-01 )

# def parse_from_date(request):
#     if "from" in request.GET:
#         try:
#             from_date = datetime.strptime(request.GET['from'], "%d/%m/%Y")
#         except ValueError:
#             from_date = date(1900, 1, 1)
#     else:
#        from_date = date(1900, 1, 1)
#     return from_date

Reorder accounts in any order (use jQuery UI Sortable)

Pop-up for creating new accounts within Create Transaction, like Admin
